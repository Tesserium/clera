# clera
Blows up your terminal if you mistype `clear`, but C++ version plus automatic adjustment according to the terminal size, also with more frames. Credit goes to [this repo](https://github.com/kz6fittycent/clera/tree/master).

## Installing
For most linux distros, use the following command:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tesserium/clera/master/install.sh | sh
```
The script installs an executable `clera` to `/usr/local/bin` by default. You can edit the script to make it install to somewhere else.
